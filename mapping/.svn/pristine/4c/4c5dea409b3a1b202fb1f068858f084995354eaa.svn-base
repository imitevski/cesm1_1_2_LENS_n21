Version: ref1br04_gen_runoffmap_080619
One-line summary: modify size estimates for smoothing matrix & mat-mat multiply 

map_mod.F90
- bump up size estimate for result of matrix-matrix multiple
- size is 20% greater, as required by some paleo application, circa 2011 (ask nanr)

smooth.F90
- set size estimate for smoothing matrix to max size that it can be 
  given that it is indexed with a 4-byte integer (ie. close to 2 ^ 31 -1)
- add diagnostics wrt the min, max, avg, bin'd number of cells that each src cell is smooth into

One-line summary: fix bug in nn algorithm

Changes made:

- add support for this runoff data on this domain...
  /fis/cgd/cseg/csm/inputdata/lnd/dlnd7/RX1/runoff.daitren.annual.090225.nc
  which is observational data an a regular 1x1 deg lat/lon grid
- replace optimize nn map generation algorithm with a brute-force approach
  because the optimized version doesn't work correctly.  May need to debug
  and reintroduce the optimized version for use with tx0.1 grids
- add support for bluefire, remove support for blueice

Version: ref1br01_gen_runoffmap_080619
One-line summary: update code

Changes made:

- update smoothing algorithm from jdennis
- generate nearest neighbor initial mapping on the fly
- read in raw rdirc file instead of rdirc scrip grid file
- refactor mat_mat_mult to take advantage of nearest
  neighbor implementation -- input map MUST BE nearest neighbor
- clean up some memory use issues

One-line summary: performance enhancements motivated by r05_tx0.1v2 mapping

Changes made:
- memory & efficiency mods required by hi-rez (r05_tx0.1v2) mapping
  (thanks to John Dennis)
- is hard-coded to apply smoothing only to points that are implicated in the
  destination domain of the original (unsmoothed) map (which is reasonable
  and also a lot less work).  "Implicated" means mapped to -- there may be
  many unmasked destination grid cells that are not "implicated."
  Implicated points are presumably only very near to coasts.
- used to create: map_r05_to_tx0.1v2_e1000r50_080605.nc, which apparently works OK (?)
- NOTE: has been validated as b4b with previous tag 
  (by recreating map_r05_to_tx1v1_e1000r500_080505.nc)
  WITH THE SRC MOD of *not* restricting smoothing to implicated ocn cells
  (smooths all unmasked ocn cells)

Timing info:
   o input : file_orig = 'map_r05_to_tx1v1.nc '
   o output: file_new  = 'map_r05_to_tx1v1_e1000r500_yymmdd.nc
   o very hi-rez tx0.1v2 ocn grid
   o restricted sources (only smooth implicted ocn cells)
   o only a 50km smoothing radius
   o basically: step2 = 4 hours, step3 = 4.75 hours
   o on one blueice node using 16 threads (sorting & mat-mult are threaded)

One-line summary: tag code cleanup circa Jan 2007

Changes made:
- code cleanup circa Jan 2007
- new eFold & rMax nml vars
- time stamp progress reports when making smoothing map (May 2008)
- validated against gen_runoffmap_070104 by recreating 
  map_r05_to_tx1v1_e1000r500_080505.nc (there are roundoff differences)

Version: gen_runoffmap_070104
One-line summary: new correction & sorting algorithms: faster, more accurate

Changes made:
- this code worked on 2007 Jan 2 for S. Yeager for making 
  map_r05_to_gx1v5_e1000r500_070102.nc
- all steps/phases: < 6 hrs on bluesky, threaded on 24 processors
- new correction algorithm more accurately smooths runoff data
- new sort algorithm is much faster 
- also works on bluevista, but only 8 processors are available on a node
  which is slower than 24 processors on bluesky

One-line summary:  initial import of gen_runoffmap code

Changes made:

  the kx3v1 paleo grid runoff map.
